# BCB-86 React Personal Portfolio Project

## Description
This is a sample portfolio project carried out by colleagues of BCB-86. We have used React JS and collaborated though github. All versions of the project are commited into personal branches and are merged into the 'development' branch. The development branch is then merged into the 'main' branch, which is live to the public.

## Project setup

### Clone the 'portfolio' repository in your local machine
### Open the directory in VS Code

### Install 
npm install

### To see current branches and commits
```
git log
```

### To go to the development branch
```
git switch development
```
    
### Now create a new branch with your name
```
git branch <your_name>
```

Now start your development!

You can find your named directory under 'src/components/portfolio/'

You will find most of the files you need complete your portfolio under this directory.
If you want to use any images, please create a new directory with your name under 'src/assets/' and add images to it.
Then add link to the required page.

You are always free to explore outside of the portfolio folder!
